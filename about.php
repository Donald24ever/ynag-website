                              <p><span lang="EN-GB">It was </span><span lang="EN-GB">Mario Costa, a United Nations Office on Drugs and Corruption (UNODC) Chief Executive, in 2005 while speaking at a Corruption Sensitization event in Abuja that posited that over US$400 billion has been stolen from public coffers in Nigeria. He went on to illustrate that if looted funds from Nigeria were tied end to end as dollar bills, they would stretch from earth to the moon and back – not once but seventy five times! Unfortunately, what Mario Costa did not tell us is that less than 1% of Nigerians are in control of the humungous sleuth of resources stolen from our common patrimony.</span></p>

                              <p><span lang="EN-GB">At the root of what we know as corruption is pervasive GREED. The Nigerian brand of GREED is not only pervasive, it is also primitive. People just steal what they do not need, keeping several mansions, skyscrapers, estates, cars and exotic cash while the masses struggle to feed twice a day and find it difficult to send their children to good schools. </span></p>
                              <p><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
                              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Corruption fuelled by <strong>GREED</strong> is real, alive, kicking and threatening all forms of life, decency, civilization and existence in Nigeria. Writing in the Image of Africa, Professor Chinua Achebe opined that more than 60% of resources meant for Nigeria&rsquo;s development are lost to corruption. The young generation has now seen accumulation of material things as the only evidence of God&rsquo;s blessings thereby increasing the rat race day after the day. If we don&rsquo;t all stand up to kill GREED now, GREED will not only kill us, it will end up destroying the coming generation. </span></p>

                              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Not long ago, Oxfam in its report; &ldquo;Inequality in Nigeria&rdquo;, told us how acute and extreme poverty is responsible for the rising wave of crime, violence, insurgency and terrorism in Nigeria particularly in te North East. The Report went on to posit that the combined wealth of the five wealthiest people in Nigeria which was estimated at about $US29.9 billion could end extreme poverty in Nigeria. In the estimation of Oxfam, such a pool of wealth is just what we need to end the human carnage, waste and misery in different parts of the country. </span></p>

Why will we not nag when our yesterday has been consumed by today&rsquo;s leaders and the future totally destroyed by human greed. We will nag until all Nigerians learn to control their destructive appetite for materialism. We therefore invite you to join us in this onerous journey considering your untainted antecedents and your uncommon love for Nigeria. </span></strong></p>
